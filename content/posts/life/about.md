        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">I grew up as a rich kid in Long Island, New York. After graduating high school, I went to Purdue University and realized that the education system shouldn't be the thing that determines whether a person lives a life of privilege and abundance or not, so here we are. I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to do it, but I know that if I can just help even one person elevate their socioeconomic status with technology, I'll be happy. Outside of my zealous ideology, I like to code and I'm 19. Love my girlfriend and struggle to relax since I'm always trying to think of the next idea, next iteration. I do love my Titans though.</p>
